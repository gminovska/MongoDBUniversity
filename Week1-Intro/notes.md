The `mongorestore` program writes data from a binary database dump created by mongodump to a MongoDB instance.

We used `mongorestore dump` command to import the data in the binary file within the dump directory into the database

### Homework 1.1

Using the Mongo shell, perform a find() on the collection called hw1_1 in the database m101. There is one document in this collection. Please provide the value corresponding to the "answer" key (without the surrounding quotes) from the document returned.

### Homework 1.2

Install the dependencies.

`npm install`

This should create a "node_modules" directory. Now run the application to get the answer to hw1-2:

`node app.js`

If you have the mongodb driver installed correctly, this will print out the message 'Answer: ' followed by some additional text. 

### Homework 1.3

If you have all the dependencies installed correctly, this will print the message 'Express server listening on port 3000'. Navigate to 'localhost:3000' in a browser and enter the text that is displayed on that page in the text box below.
